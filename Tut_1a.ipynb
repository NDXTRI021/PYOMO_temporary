    "We model robots as **chains** of rigid **links**. If the links follow one after the other, it's a serial chain (e.g. upper arm -> forearm). If there are branches where more than one *child* link follows from a single *parent* link, it's a parallel chain (e.g. torso -> left thigh OR right thigh).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the systems we model will be open chains, i.e. they don't involve any loops. If two parallel branches connect together, they form a closed chain (e.g. a four bar linkage system, like Baleka's leg).\n",

    "## **Coordinate Frames**\n",
    "A coordinate *frame* consists of an origin and three perpendicular axes (\\*if working in 3D).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to completely describe the location of an individual link in 3D space, you need six coordinates: the position $x,y,z$, and the orientation $\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma$ (the roll, pitch and yaw angles about these axes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **system space** is the set of all $6n$ coordinates you need to completely define the *pose* of an $n$-link system, when the position of all links is described *absolutely* (i.e. relative to the fixed world frame). This is a *maximal* coordinate system, since it needs the maximum number of coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach—the one used with Lagrange mechanics—is to use a smaller system of *generalized coordinates*. For chain systems, these typically correspond to the **joint space** of the system: the positions of all the joints between links. These are relative coordinates: rather than describing the links in the world frame, the position of the next link is defined from the previous link.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"coordinate_systems.png\" width = \"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum number of generalized coordinates you need to *completely and uniquely* describe the pose gives the number of *degrees of freedom (DOFs)* of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Double Pendulum\n",
    "We'll be generating the dynamic model for the 2D double pendulum shown in the previous image.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a 2 DOF system, since it can be defined completely by the two joint angles, $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$. (This is a *fixed base* system, since the first link is constrained such that it can only rotate. If it was a *floating base* system, where this link was free to move in all directions, we'd need an extra 2 DOFs—$x$ and $y$—to completely describe the pose.)\n",
