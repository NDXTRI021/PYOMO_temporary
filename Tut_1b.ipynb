    "\n",
    "In an unconstrained system, the displacement of the body will simply coincide with the direction of the force, but this is not always the case for constrained systems. For example, consider a simplified version of the (unit length) pendulum system acted on by a horizontal force: \n",

    "The direction of the force is best expressed in terms of the world-frame $x$ axis, but the point at which the force acts is constrained to move in a circle around the fixed axel, so the direction it actually moves in is dependent on the current angle of the pendulum $\\theta$. When the pendulum is at 0 degrees, the direction of motion instantaneously matches the direction of the force, but when it's at 90 degrees, it can't move horizontally at all, so no work can be done in that instant. \n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with this position dependence, it's helpful to introduce the idea of _virtual work_—the instantaneous work being done by the force. We express this in terms of a _virtual displacement_ as follows:\n",
    "$$\\delta W = F \\delta x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The work and displacement are \"virtual\" because they can't physically exist: a force can only displace a body (and therefore, do work) by acting over time, so no actual displacement or work can happen in an infinitesimal instant. The virtual displacement is therefore more of an indication of the direction that the system is instantaneously being moved in, while the virtual work expresses how closely that direction aligns to the direction of the force.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this pendulum example, an infinitesimal movement of the system in the positive direction of the force looks like this:\n",

    "<img src = \"virtual_displacement.png\" width = \"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're trying to do is find a new _generalized_ force $Q$, acting in the direction of our generalized coordinate, that produces equivalent virtual work, that is $\\delta W = F \\delta x = Q \\delta q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\delta W = F \\mathrm{cos}(\\theta) \\delta \\theta$, so our generalized force must be $Q = F \\mathrm{cos}(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalizing this to the vector case, we are actually getting the virtual work by calculating the dot product of a force vector $f$ and virtual displacement vector:\n",
